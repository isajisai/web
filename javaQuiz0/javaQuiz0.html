		<strong>
			1. What is JVM? Why is Java called the “Platform Independent Programming Language”?
		</strong>
		Each Java source file is compiled into a bytecode file, which is executed by the JVM. Java was designed to allow application programs to be built that could be run on any platform, without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each separate platform. A Java virtual machine makes this possible, because it is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the underlying hardware platform.

		<strong>
			2. What is the Difference between JDK and JRE?
		</strong>
		 The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is basically the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where your Java programs are being executed. It also includes browser plugins for applet execution. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is the full featured Software Development Kit for Java, including the JRE, the compilers and tools (like 
		 <code>JavaDoc</code> and <code>Java Debugger</code>).
